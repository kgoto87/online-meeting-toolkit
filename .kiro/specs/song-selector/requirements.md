# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds song selection functionality to the Online Meeting Toolkit Chrome extension, allowing users to choose between available background music tracks directly from the floating toolbar. Currently, the music player exists but users cannot change songs - this enhancement will provide a dropdown or button interface to switch between the available audio files including the existing tracks and the newly available `devil_in_electric_city.mp3`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want to select different background music tracks from the toolbar, so that I can choose music that fits my mood or meeting context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a song selection control THEN the system SHALL display a list of available music tracks
2. WHEN the user selects a different song THEN the system SHALL switch to playing the selected track
3. WHEN a song is playing and the user selects a new song THEN the system SHALL stop the current song and start the new one
4. WHEN the user selects a song THEN the system SHALL remember this preference for future sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want to see which song is currently selected, so that I know what music is playing or will play when I start the music player.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the music player interface is visible THEN the system SHALL display the name of the currently selected song
2. WHEN the user changes the song selection THEN the system SHALL update the display to show the new song name
3. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL display the previously selected song or a default song

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want the song selector to integrate seamlessly with the existing music player controls, so that the interface remains clean and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the song selector is added THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing music player play/pause functionality
2. WHEN the song selector is displayed THEN the system SHALL not interfere with other toolbar controls (timer, emoji)
3. WHEN the user interacts with the song selector THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for the selection
4. WHEN the toolbar is dragged THEN the song selector SHALL move with the rest of the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want the song selection to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reselect my preferred song every time I use the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a song THEN the system SHALL save this preference to Chrome storage
2. WHEN the extension is loaded in a new tab or session THEN the system SHALL load the previously selected song
3. WHEN no previous selection exists THEN the system SHALL default to the first available song
4. IF the previously selected song is no longer available THEN the system SHALL fallback to the default song
